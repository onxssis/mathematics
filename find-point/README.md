# Problem

Consider two points, _`p = (px, py)`_ and _`q = (qx, qy)`_. We consider the inversion or point reflection, _`r = (rx, ry)`_, of point _`p`_ across point _`q`_ to be a _`180deg`_ rotation of point _`p`_ around _`q`_.

Given _`n`_ sets of points _`p`_ and _`q`_, find _`r`_ for each pair of points and print two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of _`rx`_ and _`ry`_ on a new line.
